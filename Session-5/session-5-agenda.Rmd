# Meeting on 25th September 3pm.

## 1. Rstats News: "Any news in R that's interesting?"

- Cool blog posts
- R core changes?
- Any R packages we've released?

## 2. R-Help: A friendly place to discuss topics you need some help/direction with.

## 3. Reading group: Metaprogramming section of Advanced R

- Hadley appears to be actively developing this book, which has resulted in a new, but I think better chapter order.
-
- We are going to start reading through chapter 18 - expressions: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions, the whole chapter (18.1 - 18.5)
- Do the exercises
- Discuss answers and thoughts

# Future weeks

- We will then move on to Chapter 20, 21, and 22 - as it currently looks like chapter 19 "Tidy Evaluation" is not completed.

- Following this, we will move onto the chapter on Debugging, condition handling, and defensive programming: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging
