Potential outline for the coming weeks. The next quokka meeting is on the 21st September 

1. Rstats News: "Any news in R that's interesting?"

- Bring some "R show and tell" (a blog post, or a news site using R)
  - For example,    
- "surprisingly useful #rstats twitter information"
  - For example: 
    - Hadley https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/901464546996518912
- Any R packages we've released

2. Oh God, Help.

  - Ideally reproducible code that you need help with
  - But it can also be a little more of "Hey, what's this, I don't immediately know how to solve this"

3. Reading group: Metaprogramming section of Advanced R

- http://adv-r.hadley.nz/nse.html#capturing-expressions
- Chapter 17.1 discussion:
  - Read through 17.1 and do exercises.
  - Discuss answers and thoughts
  - Discuss future paths (how much and how long to read?)
